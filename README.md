# NovaRiders-SGT

The application consists of a frontend (user interface) and a backend (server responsible for processing requests). In the frontend, React is used to render components and make server requests. In the backend, Express is used to handle requests and Mongoose to interact with the database. The application uses TypeScript for data typing and dotenv to manage environment variables.

## Dependencies

- **Frontend:** React, react-router-dom, axios, @mui/material
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Mongoose, dotenv, cors

## Programming languages

- JavaScript
- TypeScript
